## Livestreamer-curses

Livestreamer-curses is a limited front-end to Chrippa's [Livestreamer](https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer) for UNIX systems.
With it you can manage a list of your favorite streams and play them (several at a time if your connection can handle it).

### Usage

Clone this repo and run `python livestreamer-curses.py`. This will initialize the database in `$HOME/.livestreamer-curses.db`
and ask you to add streams. Sorry, there is no easy way to do a batch import.

### Dependencies

* [Livestreamer](https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer)
